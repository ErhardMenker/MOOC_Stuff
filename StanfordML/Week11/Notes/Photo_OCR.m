%%% Photo OCR

%% Motivation
% Photo OCR (optical character recognition) examines photographs by...
% ...extracting/learning text that exists in them
% An ML pipeline explains how a problem will be executed with ML algorithm(s)...
% ...from the project's start to finish
% ML Pipeline Example - Photo OCR: Image -> text detection -> character...
% ...segmentation -> character recognition
% The sliding window ML algorithm traverses each portion of pixels in a...
% ...photo and trains whether the portion of photo contains something...
% ...(e.g. text or person)

%% Getting Lots of Data & Artificial Data
% Artificial data can be synthesized in photo OCR by taking each letter in...
% ...different fonts & pasting them against different backgrounds (remember,...
% ...the goal is to be able to parse letters from photos)
% Artificial distortions/warpings can be introduced to make the ML algorith...
% ...more robust to not looking "perfect" (or like the "textbook" character)
% Another distortion example is overlaying noise in the background of the...
% ...signal you desire to detect in speech recognition
% Distortion needs to be systematic; it's often not helpful to add arbitrary...
% ...noise because it's too easy to detect if it's not purposeful noise 
% Before adding more data, it is important to find evidence that the...
% ...current classifier is low bias
% A good thought experiment to decide if you should add more artificial data...
% ...is to ask if it would take much effort to generate 10 times more data...
% ...than you currently have

%% Ceiling Analysis
% Where should an ML engineer focus time to improve the algorithm?
% Ceiling analysis examines the errors generated by each portion of the...
% ...pipeline and analyzes which parts of the pipelines need to be improved...
% ...the most to enhance pipeline accuracy
% Ceiling analysis asks: if this portion of the pipeline was perfect, how...
% ...much better should the end result of the entire pipeline now be?
