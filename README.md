# MOOC_Stuff

- The MOOC_Stuff repo contains MOOC scripts & READMEs that are not self-contained pipelines worthy of their own repo (e.g. the JHU course projects/capstone which each have their own repository on this Github profile)
- Unless stated otherwise, each folder at the repo's main level houses an entire (typically Coursera) specialization or long term course (like Ng's machine learning)
- Unless stated otherwise, each specialization/course has been completed to the level desired and these are the results of the notes/homework completed for the course (notes are not updated as the course/spec is incrementally completed)
- This isn't a developmental repository intended for collaboration; it just contains notes on courses that can exist & be referenced without access to the original laptop
- Many of the projects, like those in Rice, require an online IDE (CodeSkulptor), so the scripts here are just intended to store the code easily on disk
- Each folder at this level refers to a specialization/course; a README lives in each one of these briefly explaining what the spec/course covers
