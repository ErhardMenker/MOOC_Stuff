## Machine Grading
# OwlTest is the software used for machine grading.
# OwlTest can be accessed via the specific mini-project to be submitted,...
# ...because the OwlTest parameters vary by project.
# OwlTest does not submit anything to Coursera.
# Therefore, actual projects need to be submitted to Coursera.
# Actual submission says Coursera on the page and has a white background.
# Coursera still only records the best grade.
# OwlTest and Coursera evaluation should be identical.
