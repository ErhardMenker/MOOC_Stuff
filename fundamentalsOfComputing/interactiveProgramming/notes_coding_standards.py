## Coding Style Introduction
# Teams of programmers on any project have certain abstract coding standards...
# ...to meet in order to make sure that produced code is concordant and readable.
# Coding style asks: how can code be more readable (includes the writer in the future)?

## Documentation
# Make sure to explain what each module/code block does.
# Comments should always be fronted by a #, not surrounded by """ """

## Variables
# Variables should have meaningful names to illustrate what's in it.
# Variables should be at least three characters long.
# Don't include variables that are never used.
# Don't include global variables in programs (except constants, which should be in all caps).

## Classes
# Class fields should start with underscores and be at least three characters long.
# Class fields should never be accessed directly from outside the class.
# Class creation should be hidden so class definitions are not tampered with.
