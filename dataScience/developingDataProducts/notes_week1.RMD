Developing Data Products - Week 1 
==============================================

####*Video 1.1-1.11 Shiny*

**A. What is Shiny?**

- Shiny is a web application framework for R that really only requires knowledge of R (not standard web development tools like JavaScript)
- Shiny allows the creation of graphical interfaces that allows for users to interact with visualizations, models, and algorithms without knowing the R language
- The time to create simple yet powerful web-based interactive data products in R is minimized with Shiny
- Shiny is made by the managers of RStudio
- shiny is a CRAN package that must be installed and loaded before use
- A shiny project is a directory that contains at least two R files:
    1) ui.R (for user interface) controls how your app looks
    2) server.R controls what your app does

**B. Creating a Shiny Project**

- To create a new Shiny project: 
    1) go to: File -> New File -> Shiny Web App
    2) This prompts a New Shiny Web Application dialog box, call it a useful name
    3) It is best to have multiple files (ui & server), not combined into an app
    4) Input the titlePanel, sidebarPanel, & mainPanel text in ui.R that will show when the app is run
    5) Run the app by selecting "run app" in the upper right corner of RStudio or executing "runApp()"
- The sidebarPanel has inputs while the mainPanel has outputs
    
**C. HTML as It Relates to Shiny**

- Knowledge of HTML helps in using Shiny because Shiny uses aspects of HTML
- The wrapper functions in Shiny use standard HTML tags including h1() - h6(), p(), a(), div(), & span()
- R code is placed inside a code() wrapper
- ?builder explains all of the HTML tags that can be used in a Shiny app

**D. Plotting with Shiny**

- Shiny allows the useful presentation of plots
    1) ui.R -> plotOutput()
    2) server.R -> renderPlot() 
- Shiny allows interactive programming where graphing parameters can be changed on-the-fly

**E. Reactivity**

- In order to store dynamic calculations, you have to wrap dynamic expressions in a reactive wrapper
- A reactive wrapper indicates that the variable continuously updates 
- It might not be desirable to have immediate reactivity because the value is a part of complicated calculations; in such cases a submit button is used for "delayed reactivity" via submitButton()

####*Video 1.12-1.13 Shiny Gadgets*

- A Shiny Gadget is a function that luanches a small Shiny application
- Since Shiny Gadgets are function sthey can take values as arguments and return values to the standard R pane
- Example: choose 2 numbers to multiply by interactively and return answer to the R command line

####*Video 1.14-1.15 GoogleVis*

- GoogleVis leverages Google's graphic capabilities via R
- Example: plot the value of different variables over time using Google's graphics

####*Video 1.16-1.23 Plotly*

- Plotly is a web application for creating and sharing data visualizations
- Plotly works with several mainstream programming languages
- Plotly is a package that must be installed and then loaded before each use
- plot_ly() is how graphs are called
- Immediately upon calling the plot, there are options to export via different methods (e.g. RPubs)
