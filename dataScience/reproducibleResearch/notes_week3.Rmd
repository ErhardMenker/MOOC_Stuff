Reproducible Research Week 3: Reproducible Research Checklist & Evidence-based Data Analysis
=============================================================================================

####*Video 1.1 Communicating Results*

- Because of business of managers, results of data analyses need to be presented in a written concise way
- A research paper has a predefined structure
    - Title/Author list
    - Abstract
    - Body/Results
    - Supplementary Materials
    - Code & Data
- Presenting information via email:
    - Subject line should summarize findings in one sentence if possible
    - Email body should have brief description/context of problem and a prescription based on the results
    - Attach useful files such as R Markdown files and the code/data used to generate the report
    - Providing a Github repository is a good way of giving a person all of the requisite project info

####*Video 1.2 RPubs*

- RPubs is a service provided by RStudio and can be accessed at rpubs.com (requires registered account)
- RPubs stores RMarkdowns on a website for everyone to see and comment on (every RPub is public)

####*Video 1.3-1.5 Reproducible Research Checklist*

- Start with good science
    - Garbage in -> garbage out
    - Coherent, focus the question to keep problem simplified
    - Working with good collaborators reinforces good practices
- Don't do things by hand (aka Excel), including:
    - Editing spreadsheets to remove outliers and try to do quality control/assurance
    - Editing tables or figures
    - Downloading data from a web site instead of using an API
    - Transforming data manually
- Things done in hand need to be documented for other users which is very challenging
- Avoid temptation to think that if something is done just once then it shouldn't be automated
- Don't "point & click"
    - GUIs are convenient and intuitive but cannot easily be reproduced by others
    - Ease of use often correlates with non-reproducibility
    - A man's gotta code
- The antidote to doing things by hand is doing by computer
    - Try to teach a computer to do it via code if a task needs to be done, even if only done once
    - Because computers need carefully tailored syntax, there is no "fuzziness" about what was done
    - Teaching a computer almost guarantees reproducibility
    - Example: instead of downloading data at the website by hand, use the download.file() function
- Use some version control (e.g. Git)   
    - Add changes in small chunks
    - Only commit working versions
- Keep track of the software environment, including:
    - Computer architectures (CPU vs GPU)
    - Operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux/Unix)
    - Software toolchain: Compilers, command shell, programming languages, data analysis software
    - Supporting software/infrastructure (libraries, R packages, dependencies)
    - External dependencies (web sites, remote databases)
    - Version numbers (for every component)
    - The R function sessionInfo() tells as much information as possible about the software environment
- Don't save output
    - Avoid saving data analysis ouptut
    - Save the data & code that generates the output, not the output itself
    - Intermediate files need clear documentation
- Do set a seed in random number generators
    - Random number generators generate pseudo-random numbers based on an initial seed (indicated by          number ID)
    - set.seed() is used in R
    - Setting a seed guarentees the pseudonumbers generated and ensures reproducibility of results
- Keep the idea of the entire pipeline in your decision making process
    - Make as much of the data pipeline as reproducible as possible
    - Data pipelines are complex, making steps reproducible between stages is a rewarding task

**A. Reproducibility & Replication**

- Replication and reproducibility are not the same (replication is a stricter standard)
    - Replication focuses on the true validitiy of the scientific claim and whether it can be vindicated       as new data continues to be released and/or is used from different sources
    - Reproducibility focuses on the validity of the specific data analysis in question with new              investigators but the same data and methods
- Reproducible research is a compromise between perfect replication and doing nothing toward the end of allowing recreation of an experiment
- Reproducibility assures transparency and the ability to challenge a process but does not guarentee that the underlying pipeline process is correct
- Problems must be strictly defined; even simple problems are hard to formulate and can be interpreted  in different ways

**B. Who Reproduces Research?**

- Making research reproducible is important for the end audience of people who need to reproduce
- There are 3 people who reproduce reserach:
    - The investigator (who thinks the truth is x)
    - The scientists who investigate (think the truth is x or y or...and want to be able to scrutinize        your work)
    - The general public (may not care directly but benefit greatly from the externalities of                 reproducible science)
